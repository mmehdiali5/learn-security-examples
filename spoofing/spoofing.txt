1) Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Setting sameSite: true for the cookie option in session configuration enhances security by mitigating certain types of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

When a cookie is set with the sameSite attribute set to true, it means that the cookie will only be sent in a first-party context. This prevents the cookie from being sent by the browser in cross-site requests, which can help protect against CSRF attacks.

In a CSRF attack, an attacker tricks a user's browser into making an unintended request to a different website where the user is authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user. By setting sameSite: true, you can prevent the browser from automatically including the session cookie in requests initiated by other sites.

2) Which CIA properties do you think Spoofing violates?
Confidentiality can be violated as some unauthorized app or user can access the sensitive data using CSRF attack.
