Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability in the original code lies in the lack of input validation and sanitization,
which opens up the possibility of NoSQL injection attacks. NoSQL injection occurs when untrusted data is used to
construct database queries, allowing attackers to manipulate or inject malicious code into these queries, potentially
leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Information disclosure violates the confidentiality aspect of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
triad. In the context of the provided code, if a NoSQL injection attack were successful, it could potentially lead to the
disclosure of sensitive user information stored in the database, compromising confidentiality.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Parameterized Queries: Instead of manually sanitizing inputs and constructing queries, use parameterized queries provided by database libraries. Parameterized queries separate the query logic from the data, preventing injection attacks.
Authentication: Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or OAuth, to further secure user access to the application.
Authorization: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that users only have access to the resources and actions they are authorized to perform.
