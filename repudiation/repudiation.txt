- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
In the insecure version, there is no mechanism to verify the identity of users who send messages or retrieve them.
This opens up the possibility of malicious users sending messages on behalf of others, leading to potential repudiation
issues where users deny sending certain messages.

By maintaining comprehensive audit logs, the secure version provides a reliable trail of evidence that can be used to verify
the actions performed within the system. In the event of disputes or investigations related to repudiation, these audit logs
serve as valuable forensic evidence, helping to establish the authenticity of user actions and mitigate the risk of
unauthorized access or denial of responsibility.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Additional security mechanisms that can be incorporated to prevent such attacks include:

Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data such as user credentials, authentication tokens, and messages can prevent unauthorized
access even if an attacker gains access to the server's logs or intercepted network traffic.

Input Validation: Implementing strict input validation mechanisms can prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or
cross-site scripting (XSS), which could be used to manipulate or access data illegitimately.

Audit Trails: Enhance logging mechanisms to include detailed audit trails with timestamps, user actions, and IP addresses.
This can provide comprehensive evidence in case of disputes or investigations related to repudiation.

Session Management: Implementing secure session management techniques, such as using HTTPS and securely managing session tokens,
can prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Utilize RBAC to control access to different functionalities based on users' roles and
permissions. This ensures that users only have access to the functionalities they are authorized to use, reducing the risk
of unauthorized actions and potential repudiation.
